        <h1>Minhaj's Story</h1>
        <p>This is Minhaj, and I'm going to tell everyone about a great life story of mine that depressed me too much.</p>
        <h2 class="big-font">The Weird Story of Minhaj</h2>
        <p class="story">Once, I was an ordinary guy who didn’t have any work. One day, I heard about a platform for binary trading. I don't want to share the platform's name. A few weeks later, at school, one of my best friends, Nafin, told me about it, and that’s when it piqued my interest. I practiced and asked my father for a laptop. He agreed, and I started trading. At first, I earned some money, but then came the losses, and more losses.</p>
        <p class="story">My family pressured me to give back the money, not my father, but my mother, because that was the last money my father gave her to hold the family expenses. Desperate, I looked for money here and there. Finally, I found a way to earn money, but it turned out to be the worst mistake of my life. It was a scam. They promised that if I gave them 100 bucks, they would give me a $1000 loan. So, I paid them, and they asked for another 70 bucks. I paid again, and after a long wait, they gave me a scam crypto account that supposedly contained 18k bucks. I fell for it.</p>
        <p class="story">I asked my friend Nafin for help because the scammers kept asking for 100 bucks again for verification. He helped me, and I don’t know how he managed it. The scammer then asked for another 70 bucks. Nafin loaned it to me, but we failed again. The scammers increased the amount from 18k to 22k to make me more curious, asking for another 100 bucks. This time, Nafin couldn’t find the money, so we decided to ask our classmates for help. Our loyal friend Efat stole money from his parents to help us. When I paid the scammers, they took it all and blocked me.</p>
        <p class="story">I was totally broken and even considered suicide, but Nafin saved me. Efat got caught by his parents, making the situation worse. The next day, Nafin came to my house and told my mother about everything. She was broken too and beat me so much. She sacrificed her earrings and sold them to pay back the money. Things got a bit better, and I realized the value of true friends and family. Although the situation improved, I had broken my friends' trust, and they called me a thief. I didn’t mind because of their help.</p>
        <p class="story">The moral of the story is: family and true friends never leave you in the worst situations, and never break anyone's trust. After things got better, I was depressed for a month for what I had done, but then I started a new life.</p>
